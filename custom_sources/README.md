# custom_sources

This is a collection of example custom sources to extend Datahub without the need of forking the core project.

## my-source
`my-source` is an example custom source which always returns the content of `example_mce/single_mce.json` as an MCE. It can work as a base for custom sources you may need in your project and are not available in the offical project yet.
